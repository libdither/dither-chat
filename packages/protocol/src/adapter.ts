/**
 * Adapter <-> hub protocol.
 *
 * An adapter is one process per account (a Matrix sync loop, a signal-cli
 * daemon wrapper, a sandboxed Discord web client). It speaks only in
 * *native* IDs and sends idempotent facts; the hub maps them to stable hub
 * IDs, deduplicates objects seen by several accounts, and decides what
 * the user is notified about.
 *
 * Transport: WebSocket to ws://127.0.0.1:<hub>/adapter?account=<id>&token=<token>,
 * one JSON object per text frame. The hub passes these to spawned adapters:
 *
 *   DITHER_HUB_URL         ws://127.0.0.1:8460/adapter
 *   DITHER_ACCOUNT_ID      acc_...
 *   DITHER_ADAPTER_TOKEN   per-account secret for the WebSocket
 *   DITHER_ACCOUNT_DIR     private state dir (0700) for sessions, keys, profiles
 *   DITHER_ACCOUNT_CONFIG  JSON, non-secret account config (homeserver, phone, ...)
 *
 * Secrets the user typed in (passwords, tokens) are in $DITHER_ACCOUNT_DIR/secret.json.
 * Adapters may rewrite that file (e.g. swap a password for an access token).
 *
 * Every reference inside a fact (author, conversation, replyTo, ...) is a
 * native ID on the adapter's own network.
